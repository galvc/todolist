### Todolist App

This application was created using React. This was made to test my knowledge on states and how to think in React.
I also used Grommet to explore and learn more about style libraries.

### Improvements

I will be continuing to work on the layouts and grids. I haven't grasped the full concept of Grommet yet, and would love to combine my knowledge on CSS and the power of Grommet.

Besides a few changes to the styles and layouts, I will also be adding more functionality to the app. For example: live editing, draggable lists, improved filtering, and saving.

### Learnings

I would say the biggest hurdle is finding out where the logical functions will live and when to break things down into components. I'm also unsure on the best practices for styling, so I hope to learn where I can properly put my styles in, so it doesn't distract from the logic in App.js. In addition, I need more practice on lifting states up.
